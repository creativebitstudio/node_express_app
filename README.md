Developed for CreativeBitStudio by our very own full stack developer Daniel C.


Welcome to another CreativeBitStudio tutorial.
An express-node app with Pug.

This app contains all the necessary modules to develop a simple express app to play around and test with. All the way to installing the express-generator to publish a fully functional web application.  

Technologies used

Express 4.0
Npm 4.1.1
Node 6.9.0
Pug 2.0.0 beta (can be downgraded to 2.0.0, simply) 

List of all dependencies are shown in the package.json file 

Nodemon is saved under development dependencies and is used to restart the server automatically anytime a change is made to the application. To start the server, simply type the command: nodemon app. 

Note: each file is commented explaining what each piece of code does. 

ENJOY!!
